# Create a Yugabyte Multi-Zone Universe using Platform (Anywhere)

## Introduction

In this hands-on deployment lab, you will create a Yugabyte Universe that consists of a three node cluster in a multi-zone topology. Each node will reside in the same region but in a different availability zone. The purpose is to demonstrate YugabyteDBs ability to provide high availability and workload distribution. The added resiliency in a multi-zone architecture protects against potential failures in case resources in a single availability zone become unavailable. 






## Prerequisites
